But first we need a plan. Our current approach is not working. There are many things not working, but let me focus on climate change because it is a huge problem. Emissions keep on going up. World wide agreements are made, but never for enough and emissions keep on going up. Environmentalists pin their hope on elections but then the other party gets elected and dismantles previous work. [And emissions keep on going up.](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co-emissions-by-region)

Why don't they get the importance of climate change? How can they not understand how important this is? Or if they do
understand why is it not more of a priority? What can be more important than saving the world? If a meteor was on a collision course with the earth surely *that* would capture people's
attention, so why not this?

I have an explanation, but first let's start with an experiment. Take a moment to get settled and become aware of what is going on for you. Maybe take a breath, relax and pause for a moment here. Then when you are ready read the next sentence, and pay really close attention to what happens for you.

The very worst part of the climate change disaster is probably eighty or more years away.

Now be honest with yourself. Doesn't that ease your concern at least a little? Eighty years
is an awfully long time away, and most of us won't be alive then. But then you
might argue that even right now we are suffering the effects of climate change. True the
danger of billions of people dying is a long way off, but there is plenty of
suffering to worry about in our immediate future. Yes, but now notice again how it
feels when I reframe the above statement and say that billions might die in our children's life time.
Notice how that feels different. It feels different because I have brought the issue closer into your sphere of compassion.

We all have spheres of compassion. The things in our inner sphere are the things we care most about and will protect. Typically your family is in this inner sphere. Then there are the outer parts of the sphere. Whatever group you identify with is here. Then further out is maybe your country. Or maybe only part of your country.
Perhaps you include other living things in you sphere somewhere, probably your pets (inner surely), but maybe even the planet (further out). There are limits, however, for most people, in how big this sphere can get. It is just too overwhelming to try and include too many. And outside the sphere we have little compassion whatsoever. They are the "other".

It turns out, though, that you can expand people's sphere of compassion. In fact throughout history we have gone through distinct stages where people expanded their spheres. For example, at one point slavery was perfectly OK, but then later it was not. In this country, we barely managed to expand our sphere of compassion just enough to abolish slavery, but not enough for Whites to include Blacks any closer in their sphere. We still struggle with that.  The problem is that people are at widely varying stages of expansion. If we want to save the world we need to drastically expand people's sphere of compassion.

The great news is that expanding the sphere of compassion is the solution for almost all of
what we need to do. BLM? Expand the sphere. Economic justice? Expand the sphere. Pull back from
Authoritarianism? Expand the sphere. There are not separate cries for justice, they all come
down to just one -- expand the sphere. First we have to expand the sphere to include all
people, then we need to expand even further to include the planet. And then we need to expand even further to expand all the way to our children's children.

Does this sound hard? Look, I told you this was a heroes journey. I know it is possible because it has already happened before. We just need to do it again in a much bigger way. And this time we have a deadline. No pressure.

So how has it happened before?

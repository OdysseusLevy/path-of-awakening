I love movies where the reluctant heroes are desperately trying to save the world against what seem impossible odds.
 First they overcome their fears and limitations, and then they commit. Then they work through their bitter squabbles and commit to each other. I want to be like them. I'm hoping you do too, because the world is in desperate need of heroes right now.

Police kill black men seemingly at will. Large parts of the population seem to be indifferent to the needless deaths and suffering of a million people. And it gets worse. Global warming is here and we are burning. Species are dying in numbers we can barely comprehend. In our children's lifetimes
it is possible large parts of the planet might become uninhabitable. If we don't make drastic changes, it is possible that billions of people will die. Seriously.

Still with me? I don't blame you if your first instinct is to stop reading. If you let yourself really consider how bad things could get
it is just too overwhelming. Billions of people dying? Surely that is hysterical hyperbole? It is just too much. Sadly it is a real possibility.

### There is Hope

But please know this. There is hope. Really and truly. It is not going to be easy of course. It never is in dire situations like this. And unlike the movies there is no guarantee that everything will work out in the end. But I wouldn't be writing this if
I did not truly believe there is hope.

Again it is not going to be easy. No heroic journey ever is. Are you willing to at least start? The very first step is to embrace the pain. Really let yourself feel how awful this is. Yuck! Why would you want to do that? Because with pain comes a precious gift -- the energy to do whatever it takes to get out of that pain. The bigger the pain the bigger the gift that comes with it. Think about times in your life when something hurt so bad that you just had to make a drastic change. That pain gave you the energy to make a change you might not have made otherwise. It is exactly like that but on a global scale.

We are going to need this gift of energy because we are about to embark on a heroic journey.

Ready to begin?

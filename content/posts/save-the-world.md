I love movies where the characters are desperately trying to save the world against what seem impossible odds.
I love how the heroes overcome their fears and limitations. And then they overcome their petty squabbles with each other to team up. I want to be like them. I'm hoping you do too, because the world is in desperate need of heroes to step up right now.

In our children's lifetimes
large parts of the planet might become uninhabitable. If we don't make drastic changes, it is possible that billions of people will die. Seriously.

Still with me? I don't blame you if your first instinct is to stop reading. If you let yourself really consider how bad things could get
it is just too overwhelming. Billions of people dying? Surely that is hysterical hyperbole? It is just too much. Sadly it is a real possibility.

### There is Hope

But please know this. There is hope. Really and truly. It is not going to be easy of course. It never is in dire situations like this. We already
know that from the movies. And unlike the movies there is no guarantee that everything will work out in the end. But I wouldn't be writing this if
I did not truly believe there is hope.

Again it is not going to be easy. No heroic journey ever is. Are you willing to at least start? The very first step is to embrace the pain. Really let yourself feel how awful this is. Why would you want to do that? Because with pain comes a precious gift -- the energy to deal with that pain. The bigger the pain the bigger the gift that comes with it. Think about times in your life when you something hurt so bad that you had to make a drastic change. The pain gave you energy to make a change you might not have made otherwise. It is exactly like that but on a global scale.

We are going to need this gift of energy because we are about to embark on a heroic journey.

So what's the plan?
